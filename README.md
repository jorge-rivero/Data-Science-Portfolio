- “Mahalanobis Distance Metric Learning Algorithm for Instance-based Data Stream Classification”, in Proc. of the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2016), Vancouver, Canada, July 24–29, 2016.: A new algorithm that learns a Mahalanobis metric using similarity and dissimilarity constraints in an online manner. This approach hybridizes a Mahalanobis distance metric learning algorithm and a k-NN data stream classification algorithm with concept drift detection.
